    By and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and
    blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of
    seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the
    afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what
    happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he
    didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and
    found her gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn't
    get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get
    the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an
    uncommon level head for a nigger.
